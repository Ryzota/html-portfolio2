 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>American Sniper</h3>
   <p>This is based on true story at war age.</p>
   <p>When I watched it for the first time, I ended up crying crazy</p>

<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
   <p>This is made in Ghibl Studie of Japanese Company</p>
   <p>Since I was borned and rasied in Japan, I had a oppotunity to watch when I was a kid</p>
   <p>It is too sad and emotioanll for childrenn but it is also educated about war.</p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
   <p>This is a movie that is made in USA</p>
   <p>I like that smart children use various stretegies and beat bad people by himself.</p>
